## Overview

**`VIUSr`** is an R package developed to facilitate the cleaning, exploration, and visualization of data from the 2021 Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) conducted across the United States. This package provides a suite of tools to streamline the workflow from raw data to actionable insights, supporting users in extracting meaningful patterns at both national and state levels.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Efficiently prepares raw VIUS 2021 data into a tidy, analysis-ready format with minimal user intervention.
- **State-Level Exploration**: Generate focused summaries and visualizations for individual U.S. states to understand regional vehicle usage patterns.
- **Cross-State Comparison**: Compare metrics across states to identify trends and outliers in vehicle inventory and usage.
- **National Overview**: Access high-level summaries and visual representations of key statistics across the entire U.S.
- **Built-In Visualization Tools**: Create interactive and publication-ready plots, including maps and charts, with intuitive functions designed for ease of use.

`VIUSr` is ideal for transportation analysts, researchers, policy makers, and data professionals seeking to work with VIUS 2021 data in a reproducible and interpretable manner.


## Installation

You can install the development version of VIUSr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jashonnew/VIUSr_rfDSP_Final_Project")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(VIUSr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
